# Project Progress & TODO Summary

## What Has Been Done

1. **WebSocket Connection Fixed**
   - Backend (Node.js/Socket.IO) and frontend (React/Vite) servers are running and connect properly.

2. **Room Creation & Joining**
   - Users can create and join rooms.
   - Backend and frontend communicate via Socket.IO events.

3. **Chat Functionality**
   - Fixed message field mismatches (`message` vs `content`).
   - Real-time chat implemented: users can send and receive messages.
   - Messages display immediately for the sender.

4. **User ID Synchronization**
   - Frontend now uses `socket.id` (from backend) as the user identifier.
   - All message and participant logic updated to use `socket.id`.

5. **Debugging & Logging**
   - Console logs added to trace message flow and user ID comparisons.

## Current Issues / Pending Work

1. **Participant Count**
   - Sometimes only 1 participant is shown, even if multiple users are in the room.
   - Needs investigation: check how participant list is updated on frontend and how backend emits participant data.

2. **Message Visibility**
   - Previously, users only saw their own messages due to user ID mismatch.
   - This should now be fixed, but needs to be tested with multiple users.

3. **Testing Needed**
   - Open multiple browser windows/tabs, join the same room, and send messages.
   - Confirm all users see each other's messages and participant list updates correctly.

## What To Do Next

- [ ] Test chat and participant list with multiple users (browsers/tabs).
- [ ] Debug and fix participant count if still incorrect.
- [ ] Refactor code for clarity and maintainability (optional, after core features work).
- [ ] Add user-friendly error handling (e.g., for failed connections or room joins).
- [ ] Implement user authentication (optional, for real-world use).
- [ ] Add video/audio streaming functionality (if not already done).
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for critical logic.
- [ ] Update documentation (README, setup instructions, usage guide).

**If you return after a break:**
- Review this file for current status and next steps.
- Check recent git commits for code changes.
- Start by testing the app with multiple users to verify chat and participant features.
